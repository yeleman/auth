The registration_ng app provides a interface for creating, updating,
and deleting RapidSMS contacts as rapidsms.contrib.registration does, but
allowing i18n for keywords and some special anwsers if the contact already
exists.

The code is based on the one from rapidsms.contrib.registration and hence
share the same licence.
